# Pseudo Code for Transformer Model

## SelfAttention Class
- Initialize with embed_size, heads
- Calculate head_dim as embed_size divided by heads
- Assert embed_size is divisible by heads
- Define linear transformations for values, keys, queries, and output
- Forward method:
  - Reshape inputs for multi-head attention
  - Apply linear transformations
  - Calculate attention scores using einsum
  - Apply mask if provided
  - Calculate attention using softmax
  - Apply attention to values and reshape
  - Return output through final linear layer

## TransformerBlock Class
- Initialize with embed_size, heads, dropout, forward_expansion
- Create SelfAttention instance
- Define two LayerNorm instances and a sequential feed-forward network
- Forward method:
  - Apply self-attention
  - Apply dropout and normalization
  - Pass through feed-forward network
  - Apply dropout and normalization again
  - Return output

## Encoder Class
- Initialize with src_vocab_size, embed_size, num_layers, etc.
- Create word_embedding and position_embedding layers
- Create a ModuleList of TransformerBlock instances
- Forward method:
  - Generate positional indices
  - Apply embeddings and sum them
  - Pass through each Transformer layer
  - Return output

## DecoderBlock Class
- Similar structure to TransformerBlock but includes additional source mask and target mask handling in the forward method

## Decoder Class
- Initialize with trg_vocab_size, embed_size, num_layers, etc.
- Similar structure to Encoder but processes target sequences and interacts with encoder output

## Transformer Class
- Initialize with src_vocab_size, trg_vocab_size, padding indices, etc.
- Create Encoder and Decoder instances
- Define methods for source and target mask creation
- Forward method:
  - Create masks
  - Obtain encoder output
  - Pass through decoder with masks
  - Return output

## TransformerDemo Class
- Initialize with model parameters and device
- Define a method to run a demonstration of the model
  - Execute model forward pass with sample data
  - Print output shape

## Main Execution Block
- Check for CUDA availability
- Create TransformerDemo instance with parameters
- Prepare sample input and target tensors
- Execute demonstration method

This pseudo-code outlines the structure and logic of the Transformer model implementation in PyTorch, encapsulated within classes that handle different aspects of the model's functionality.
